# obs_aimp_text_autoscroller
refreshing aimp track autoscroller. replacement for the built-in scroll filter. you can customize it as you need.
in OBS insert the HTML source using Browser Source - a local file. xDD.
before u start create your stream.txt file using ur aimp plugin like "current track info to file"
